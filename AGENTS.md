# Agent Rules

## Branching: Continuous Staging and On-Demand Main Synchronization

> This section takes precedence over any other branch or pull-request-target instruction in this file.
> `main` is this repository's production branch.

The development workflow is continuous and is not restricted to a daily schedule, a single task, or a fixed number of tasks.

- Before beginning a new development cycle, inspect the relationship between `main` and `staging` and synchronize them when necessary.
- All task branches must originate from the latest `staging`.
- Completed tasks must be submitted through PRs targeting `staging`.
- Developers may continue starting and completing additional tasks for as long as needed.
- Do not synchronize `staging` into `main` automatically after each task, after a fixed time interval, or simply because the day has ended.
- Synchronize `staging` into `main` only when the team explicitly decides that the accumulated changes are ready for delivery.
- Before synchronization, validate the combined changes and complete all required reviews and checks.
- Never merge unfinished or known-broken changes into `main`.
- After synchronization, verify the resulting branch state before continuing.
- **When a task is done, ask the repository owner / team lead whether it is all good.** They decide whether it merges and when `staging` is synchronized; an agent's or author's own judgment is not approval.
- **Check deploy triggers before merging into `staging`:** some repos deploy on pushes to `staging` (see `.github/workflows/`). Merging is a deployment decision, not just a code review.
- **Project board:** move the item through the product's GitHub Project — Backlog → To-Do → In progress → Done.

**Workflow:** Establish baseline → Develop tasks → Merge completed tasks into staging → Continue working or synchronize to main when ready → Repeat.

`staging` is the continuous integration branch. `main` is updated on demand when the team chooses to deliver the accumulated changes.

```bash
# Start a task
git fetch origin
git log --oneline origin/main..origin/staging   # what staging has that main doesn't
git checkout staging && git pull
git checkout -b <type>/<short-description>      # feat/, fix/, docs/, test/, chore/ ...

# Finish a task: open a PR into staging (never into main)
gh pr create --base staging

# Deliver (only when the owner decides): one PR from staging into main
gh pr create --base main --head staging
```
